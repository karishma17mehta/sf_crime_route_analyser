# üö¶ SF Crime-Aware Route Recommender

A real-time Streamlit web app that recommends **safer walking routes** in San Francisco by integrating:

- OpenRouteService API for route generation  
- Live crime data from SF Open Data Portal  
- A machine learning model to assess route risk  
- Interactive map visualizations with real-time rerouting

---

## What It Does

This app allows a user to:
- Enter **start and end locations**
- Specify **time of day** and **day of the week**
- View the safest walking route based on:
  - ML-predicted risk of crime
  - Recent (last 24‚Äì48 hrs) reported crime near the route
- See if rerouting was applied and why

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Model

- **Model**: Logistic Regression (`scikit-learn`)
- **Inputs per route point**:
  - `latitude`, `longitude`
  - `hour`, `minute`
  - `day_of_week` (one-hot encoded)
- **Output**: Probability score indicating risk of crime
- Route risk is the **average risk score** across all path points

---

## üîÑ Live Rerouting Logic

1. Crime incidents from the **last 24‚Äì48 hours** are pulled live from SF Open Data
2. The app checks if **any route point** is within ~50 meters of a recent crime
3. If:
   - Route passes near crime points
   - OR average risk score > 0.5  
   ‚Üí Then rerouting is triggered
4. Rerouting:
   - Applies a **latitude shift** (buffer) to nudge the route
   - Recalculates risk on the rerouted path
   - Chooses the safer of the two paths

---

## üìç Map Features

- Safe and unsafe routes are color-coded (`green` / `red`)
- Crime incidents are plotted as **red markers**
- Risk per route point is visualized via color-coded circles
- If rerouting occurred, an explanation is displayed
